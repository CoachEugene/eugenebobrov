        <h3 class=heading-tertiary>Childhood</h3>
        <p class="step-description">I was born in 1987 in Ukraine into a family where football was more than just a sport. I believe my passion and affection for football were inherited even before I was born. As a young player, I didn't have the talent or abilities to make it to the top. Starting at the age of 10, I played 11-aside, with my main task being "don't screw up on the ball." I grew up in a tough "sink-or-swim" football environment where only exceptional youngsters had a chance to shine. Despite all the obstacles, my commitment and determination allowed me to play for some local youth selections, but not much more than that.

      <h3 class=heading-tertiary>Adolescence</h3>
      <p class="step-description">At the age of 15, after being released from the academy and dealing with some health issues, I switched my focus to education. In university, I discovered futsal and found it much more enjoyable due to the increased involvement with the ball. Futsal, my teammates, and my first successful tournament results reignited my passion and showed me that it was too early to give up on my dream to be engaged in the sport. Within 4 years, I reached a decent level of play in futsal in Donetsk. I was invited to play for some semi-professional clubs, where I had the opportunity to witness different coaching approaches, methodologies, and styles. More importantly, I started reflecting on what would have happened if I and the others had been exposed to a different environment during the early stages of the football development.

        <p class="step-number">03</p>
        <h3 class=heading-tertiary>Moving to China</h3>
        <p class="step-description">In 2014, the war in my Homeland brought a lot of changes in my life. I moved to China where I had an opportunity to find the answers to my "what if" questions and made my dream come true. When I turned 35 in 2022, I made my debut in professional sport participating in the CFA Futsal Super League. Honestly, it was a bumpy road experience along with the terrifying news from Ukraine and struggles to keep up with my studying. My performance on the pro futsal ground was far away from what I expected, but I’m proud and happy for taking this short-term challenge and have a chance to compete with many great players. 2023 was another important milestone in my life. Completing my master's degree in performance coaching was full of effort, doubts, sacrifices and lots of coffee. Nevertheless, it was done. And as the cherry on the cake, it was done with distinction.

          <p class="step-description">For almost a decade, I have dedicated myself as a coach to promote and develop football in China, assuring my expertise and effectiveness in working with different age groups and abilities. For the last 4 years, I have been working within a youth football academy FC Sheznhen Greenfield, which is a highly respected club in Guangdong Province. The academy set its central identity around focusing on developing home-grown players and securing its competitive level participating in the regional and national tournaments despite the local grassroots status.

   </h2>
   <p class="playing-description">
     When I was a young player, I never had the opportunity to fulfill my dream of becoming a professional athlete. Therefore, "killing the player inside me" was something I never worried about after I decided to become a youth coach at the age of 27. It's much more important to overcome your ego that prevents you from reflecting and learning as a coach. On the contrary, my relatively short and late professional career, which began when I turned 35, serves as compelling evidence for the players I coach, validating the seemingly trivial words: "Nothing is impossible."
   </p>
   <p class="playing-description">
     I still play and work out regularly, in addition to my full-time coaching commitments. I strive to stay in good shape, serve as a role model for my players by demonstrating football skills, and gain new playing experiences, which could help me in my coaching as well. Moreover, playing football is the best communication tool in the football environment, isn't it?
